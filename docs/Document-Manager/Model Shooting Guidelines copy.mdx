# Model Measurements Required

## For Bags
- Model's height (for bags with straps)

## For Jewellery
- Height of the model
- Face length
- Ear measurements (for earrings)

## For Sunglasses
- Model’s face dimensions

# Model Look

## Makeup
Typical brand guidelines for makeup can be followed. However, we recommend that you leverage neutral looks that can be combined with any variety of accessories. If the model has visible tattoos that are not desired, you will need to cover these with makeup or remove them in post. Fingernails should be clean with no or nude-colored polish unless otherwise desired.

## Hair
Hairstyles can be congruent with the model’s natural aesthetic. We encourage a portion of the shoot to be done with the hair up and off shoulders, as well as a portion with the hair down and placed behind the ears. This gives a good variety for different product categories.

**NOTE**: Hair should be kept in such a way that it does not interfere with the product. If the model’s hair is difficult to control in this way, simply put the hair up in a loose bun or ponytail.

## Clothing
Models are to be clothed/styled as per your requirements. Keep in mind the clothing is not to obstruct the product.

For example, if the model is wearing a shirt, make sure the collar is unbuttoned so that the shot can be used for necklaces, chains, etc.

## Lighting
Lighting should be consistent across both the model and product photoshoots. The primary lighting goal should be that inputs for the model and the inputs for the product look the same. When in doubt, set up lighting to be as similar to the product lighting.

You may use your brand’s specific lighting aesthetic, if applicable. Otherwise, our standard lighting guidance is as follows:

The model should be well-lit with soft, diffused lighting. Avoid harsh shadows, bright highlights, and fully-white backdrops/backgrounds.

# Model Poses for Purse/Bag

## For Crossbody/Sling Bags
The poses can be standard. There are no specific arm or leg positions required as these bag types can be easily shown on either a front or side angle. 

**Examples below:**

## For Hand Held Bags
The bags can be shown in the side angles - either the 45 degree angle or the 90 degree angle. In some cases, they can also be shown in the front pose. The key here is to ensure there are at least 1-2 model poses shot with the model’s hands slightly clenched as she would when holding a hand held bag.

## For Shoulder Bags
The model can be posed in the side angle with the arms bent naturally as they would while holding a shoulder bag. The arms can also be simply let down like a standard 90 degree pose.

## For Backpacks
Most standard back poses of the model will work without needing any specific arm or leg movements.

# Headshots for Jewellery

Please consider doing a number of assorted closer shots in which the composition of the shot is a closer crop (waist up or similar), and the model is posed in ways that might be chosen to feature jewelry for female models (earrings, necklaces, bracelets, and rings), and for males, focus on varied headshots for things like sunglasses, watches, necklaces, or earrings.

There are no particular limitations on posing, feel free to take creative liberty and shoot a variety of variations in head position and expressions.

# Model Poses for Sunglasses

Front facing views of the model are preferred.

Front and 45 degree model poses are supported. For these model poses, the corresponding product views must also be provided. Models should be shot with even lighting and minimal shadows on the face.

Close-up views of the model’s face are preferred. 

Client can opt to choose other zoomed-out views after consulting with Vue.ai.

## Rejected Model Poses

Models in these positions cannot be supported since these are not standard product shots of sunglasses.

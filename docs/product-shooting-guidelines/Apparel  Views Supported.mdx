# Bags

## Shoulder Bag & Crossbody Bag

- **Preferred**: The bag should be presented either on a hanger or placed down, providing front and side views, along with any additional angles supporting the model's presentation.
- **Measurements Required**: Length, Width, Height, and Strap Length (if available).
  - If strap length is unavailable, please indicate the desired placement on the model via reference imagery.
  - Ensure that the strap does not obstruct any part of the bag's body.
- **Views of Bag Required**: Front and side.

## Belt Bags (Adjustable Straps)

- **Measurement of Strap**: If strap measurement is unavailable, specify the positioning and method of placement on the model.
  - Ensure that the strap does not obstruct any part of the bag's body.
- **Views of Bag**: Front and side views depend on the desired positioning on the model. The bag does not necessarily need to be displayed on a hanger.
  - For consistency, if the preferred style for the belt bag is a slanted side view, VueModel will also require the product images to be captured from the same angles, using a reference image as a guide.

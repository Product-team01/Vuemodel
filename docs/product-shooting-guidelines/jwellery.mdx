# Photoshoot Guidelines

- **Minimum Dimension & Resolution Required**: 3000 x 3000 px | 72 dpi
- The product should be in focus so the details of the product are seen clearly in the output.
- The exact tone of the product (metal, stone, beads, etc.) in the input will be reflected in the output.
- In case of metals, the finish (glossy or matte) on the final product depends on the input provided.
- The product should be shot in even lighting.

## Earrings

- **Product View Required**: Front view of the earrings.
- **Measurements Needed**: Product height & width, diamond size, pearl size.
- The direction of the earring shot should be aligned with the way the model is posed. If the model pose used is diagonal, the direction of the earring shot should also be shot at the same angle.
- For earrings that come as a set, we require styling guidelines or reference images to understand the clientâ€™s expectation.

## Ideal Space and Background Specs

- For the product images provided, it is important for the product image to be in focus and occupy a significant portion of the background space.
- Even when the product images provided are in high resolution, if the image consists of majority white space and the product appears too small, it would be difficult to process the files and retain the details of the product as the product would be quite small in frame.

## Key points 
Vue.ai recommends the input images provided by the customers to be less compressed. We would require the product images to be a smaller file size without minimizing the overall quality of the product. For product categories like jewellery, it is essential for the images to be less compressed in order to retain the details of the product regardless of the resolution to maintain optimum quality. We recommend 3000x3000 72 dpi as the minimum resolution requirement  for  customers to provide product images as this would produce optimum generation results.  

## Bracelets

- **View of the Product Required**: Front view
- **Measurements Required**: Product length, diamond size, pearl size
- All the loops and links of the bracelet should be clear and in focus for optimum result.

## Model Shooting Guide

### Apparel

**Model Look Requirements:** For female makeup, adhere to typical brand guidelines, prioritizing neutral looks adaptable to various clothing categories. Cover visible tattoos and nude-colored fingernails, unless alternate styles are specified. Male hairstyles should align with the model’s natural aesthetic. For females, include shots with hair both up and down, and placed behind the shoulders, as well as down and placed behind the shoulders.

**NOTE:** Hair should be kept behind the model's shoulders/body in ALL perspectives. If the model’s hair is difficult to control in any way, simply put the hair up in a loose bun or ponytail.

### Attire guidelines

- Models can wear neutral/nude-colored underwear and strapless/adhesive bras to ensure AI-generated compositions are free from visible clothing.
- Visible piercings/jewelry should be removed or concealed, with the option for small/simple jewelry to be edited out in post-production if necessary.
- Multiple types of footwear are recommended for versatility, including neutrally colored options such as black, white, tan/nude, or brown.
- Women’s footwear options include high heels, sandals, sneakers, flats, boots, or low-heel ballet shoes, with barefoot also suitable for nightwear if applicable.
- For men, recommended footwear includes dress shoes, athletic sneakers, casual sneakers, and boots, with barefoot also acceptable for nightwear if applicable.

## Model Poses 

For each different pair of shoes and hairstyles, shoot poses at the desired angles for the output images. These are typically one or more of the following: Front, Side 90, and back.


## General guidance for all poses:

When shooting full-body poses for apparel, aim for simplicity, naturalness, and variation. Avoid crossing arms in front or behind the torso to maintain product visibility. Limit extreme poses to approximately 15 degrees from neutral. Vary head position, tilt, and expressions for diversity. For 90-degree poses, ensure the model's torso is parallel and at a 90-degree angle to the camera. Start with a basic static pose and gradually introduce variations in weight shifts, leg positions, and minor rotations for increased diversity. See reference pose examples for guidance.
90-degree poses: These viewpoints have the least amount of variability, and should be relatively simple. 90-degree poses should have the torso/hips parallel and 90 degrees to the camera so that only the side of the model is visible.

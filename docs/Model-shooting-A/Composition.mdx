## Composition and Style

1. **Full-Body Photos:** Ensure the entire product or model is captured within the frame, unless otherwise specified.
2. **Neutral Background:** Use a plain white or light grey background to make the product/model stand out.
3. **Consistent Framing:** Keep the framing consistent across all photos to maintain uniformity.

## Lighting

1. **Soft, Neutral Lighting:** Use softboxes or diffusers to create even, shadow-free lighting. Avoid harsh, direct light that can create strong shadows.
2. **Slight Directional Bias:** Position the main light source slightly to one side to create gentle shadows that add depth and dimension without being too dramatic.

## Camera Setup

1. **Tripod Usage:** Mount your camera on a tripod to ensure stability and consistency across shots.
2. **Non-Dramatic Perspective:** Shoot from a straight-on perspective at the product's level. Avoid high or low angles that could distort the product's appearance.
3. **Camera Settings:**
   - **Aperture:** Use a mid-range aperture (f/8 to f/11) to ensure the entire product is in focus.
   - **Shutter Speed:** Set a shutter speed that avoids motion blur (use a remote trigger or timer to prevent camera shake).
   - **ISO:** Keep the ISO low (100-400) to maintain image quality without noise.

## General Lighting Setup

1. **Soft, Diffused Lighting:** Use softboxes or diffusers to create even, soft lighting that minimizes harsh shadows and bright highlights.
2. **Avoid Fully-White Backdrops:** Use a light grey or off-white backdrop to avoid the harshness of a pure white backdrop and to help the product stand out.

## Lighting Configuration

1. **Key Light:** Position your main light (softbox or large diffuser) slightly to one side (45 degrees) of the model or product. This light should be the strongest to create a slight directional bias in the shadows.
2. **Fill Light:** Place a fill light on the opposite side of the key light, at a lower intensity, to reduce harsh shadows without eliminating them completely.
3. **Background Light (Optional):** Use a backlight or hair light to add depth and separation from the background. This light should be subtle and placed behind the subject.

## Most common setup followed

1. **Camera Height:** Set the tripod so the camera is at the model’s waist level. For a standing model, this is typically around 3-4 feet from the ground, depending on the model’s height.
2. **Lens and Distance:** With a 70mm lens or longer, position the camera 10-15 feet away from the model or product. Adjust the distance as necessary to frame the full-body shot while minimizing distortion.

## Lighting and Background

1. **Soft, Neutral Lighting:** Continue using soft, directional lighting to highlight the product without creating harsh shadows.
2. **Consistent Background:** Use a plain white or light grey background for a clean and professional look.


## Specific Setup for Model Photos

1. **Key Light:** Position a softbox at a 45-degree angle to the model, slightly above eye level. This creates soft, directional shadows that provide shape and depth.
2. **Fill Light:** Place a fill light on the opposite side of the key light, at a lower intensity, to reduce harsh shadows without eliminating them completely.
3. **Background Light:** If using a backdrop, ensure it is evenly lit to avoid distracting shadows or uneven lighting.
4. **Hair Light:** Place a fill light on top of the model to emphasize the hair detail.

## Specific Setup for Product Photos

1. **Key Light:** Place a softbox or diffuser at a 45-degree angle to the product, slightly above the product’s level. This mirrors the lighting setup used for the model.
2. **Fill Light:** Position a fill light on the opposite side of the key light to balance the shadows and create an even lighting effect.
3. **Background Light:** Ensure the background is evenly lit to maintain consistency with the model photos.

## Lighting Consistency Tips

1. **Use Identical Light Modifiers:** Use the same type and size of softboxes or diffusers for both model and product shoots to ensure the light quality remains consistent.
2. **Match Light Intensity:** Adjust the intensity of the lights to match between the model and product setups. Use a light meter if necessary to ensure even exposure.
3. **Consistent Camera Settings:** Use the same camera settings (aperture, shutter speed, ISO) for both shoots to maintain consistency in exposure and depth of field.
4. **Test Shots:** Take test shots of both the model and product with the same lighting setup and compare them to ensure consistency.

## Post-Processing

1. **Color Correction:** Ensure colors are accurate and consistent with the actual product.
2. **Brightness and Contrast:** Adjust to ensure the product is well-visible without being washed out or too dark.
3. **Consistency:** Apply the same editing style to all photos to maintain a uniform look.
4. **Selecting Best shots:** ensuring all image shot are focused, texture preserved and true to the product/model

## Additional Tips

1. **Model Poses:** If using models, instruct them to adopt natural, relaxed poses that show off the product effectively - refer model pose guide.
2. **Detail Shots:** Detail shots are part of the product, make sure the match keeping the model aligned to the detailed shot.
3. **Props and Styling:** Keep props minimal and relevant to the product to avoid distracting from the main subject.

## Camera Placement and Lens Choice

1. **Mid-Model Height:** Position the camera around waist-high to the model. This angle helps capture the product or model in a natural and proportionate manner.
2. **Longer Lens (70mm or Greater):** Use a telephoto lens with a focal length of 70mm or greater. Longer lenses reduce distortion by flattening the perspective, ensuring that the product or model’s features are accurately represented.
3. **Distance from Subject:** Place the camera further away from the subject. This distance, combined with a longer lens, helps in minimizing distortion and capturing true proportions.

## Avoiding Feature Distortion

1. **Avoid High/Low Angles:** Maintain a straight-on perspective at the subject’s level. High or low angles can exaggerate features and lead to distortion.
2. **Tripod Usage:** Use a sturdy tripod to keep the camera stable and at a consistent height and distance from the subject.

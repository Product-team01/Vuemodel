## Optimal Mannequin Choice for Showcasing Laced Lingerie Products:

When displaying laced lingerie products, it is advisable to utilize a skin-tone mannequin rather than a white mannequin or one covered with a skin-toned bodysuit. This is because the white hue of the mannequin may reflect in the output, potentially compromising the overall realism.

## Consistency Issues with Ill-Fitted Garments on Mannequins:

Input provided should be devoid of folds or creases, as they will be preserved in the output. When a garment fits improperly on a mannequin, particularly in the crotch area, it can result in inconsistencies or inaccuracies in the final representation of the garment. We prefer inputs with minimal looseness in the crotch area to achieve a more authentic appearance in the final product.

## Supported File Format

If the input files are in the form of 3D files, the supported format may include commonly used file formats such as:
- **GLTF files** with textures as a zip file (this is preferred for scalable renders)
- **OBJ/MTL files** with textures as a zip file

## Processing and Turnaround Time

Please note that using these files as input, the rendering process involves ensuring that the garments are accurately represented in appropriate lighting conditions, hence there might be a slightly longer turnaround time initially. This is necessary to achieve the desired level of realism and quality in the final rendered images.

In the beginning stages, we will also allocate additional time to verify that the colors, patterns, and details are accurately represented in the rendered images and send these rendered samples to you for confirmation before proceeding with the production.

## Best Practices When Sending 3D Inputs

- We require the 3D files in zipped format along with textures.
- The styling info has to be shared with us with specific details if any.
- The desired RGB values of the final output (including the trims) must be shared.
- The model selection is done automatically or by manually selecting the desired models.
- The HDRI file used for the 3D files is required in order to get the accurate lighting & colors.
- Please ensure that the garments are positioned in a neutral "A" pose for optimal rendering.
- It will be great to provide the garment with the required texture intact to get the best quality outputs.
- Ensure all the garment details such as stitch lines, button details, creases, garment fall etc. are intact and are shown the way they should be presented on the model.

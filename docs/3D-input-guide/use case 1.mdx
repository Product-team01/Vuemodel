## 3D Garments As 2d File

### Supported File Format:
- **PNG**: Most ideal format with a transparent background.
- **JPEG**: Also supported.

### Preferred File Size:
- **Resolution**: Ideally 3000 px, minimum 2000 px acceptable.

### Rendering and Lighting Guidelines:

1. **Rendering Angles**:
   - Render the 3D files in angles required as per the model’s pose/angle, including Front, Back, and Side angles.

2. **Light Setup Guidelines**:
   - **Default Software Lighting**: Garments are produced using 3D design software (e.g., CLO, Browzwear) with default lighting settings. It's recommended to match the lighting of the garment with the model’s lighting during rendering for consistency and enhanced realism.
   - **Vue.ai Models**: Adhere to specified light setup values provided by the Vue.ai team, which includes light angle, rotation, exposure, and other relevant parameters.
   - **Own Models**: If using your own models, ensure the light setup during rendering matches the model’s lighting. Vue.ai team can assist in setting up the lighting.

### Example Illustrations:

- **Image 3**: Final result after rendering ![Final Result](https://d1r1e7xjkfj7nz.cloudfront.net/3D_input_guide3.png)

These examples show the importance of proper lighting settings to achieve realistic results in garment rendering.

### Supported File Format:
The most ideal format is PNG with a transparent background or JPEG input

### Prefered file size:
The ideal supported resolution is 3000 px but we can work from 2000 px and above.

### Details:
1. The 3D files must be rendered in the required angles as per the model’s pose/angle (for eg. Front, Back, Side angles).

2. Follow the light setup guidelines mentioned below to achieve the most ideal results.

   a) Since the garments are produced using a 3D design software such as CLO, Browzwear etc. they come with a default lighting. For optimal results, it is recommended to match the lighting of the garment to the lighting of the model during the garment rendering process. This ensures consistency and enhances the realism of the final outcome.
   
   b) If Vue.ai models are to be used for the engagement, it is important to adhere to the specified light setup values provided by the Vue.ai team during the rendering process. This includes factors such as light angle, rotation, exposure, and other relevant parameters.
   
   c) If you choose to use your own models then the light setup during the rendering process should match the selected model’s lighting. If required, Vue.ai team will guide you on how to set up the lighting for any given model.

## Best practices when sending 2d inputs:

The quality of the outputs is directly influenced by the quality of the inputs provided. Therefore, it is essential to ensure that all garment details such as stitch lines, button details are intact and accurately represented in the way they should be presented on the model. 

- Rendered 2D inputs are required, either as PNG with transparent background (preferred) or JPEG format.
- The model selection is done automatically or by manually selecting the desired models.
- The styling info with specific details (look reference) if any has to be shared.
- Images should be rendered close to 3k pixels tall for best quality.
- Limit the presence of JPEG artifacts where possible by choosing less compression during export.

## Best practices when sending swimwear:

Due to the inadequate representation of butt shape and shadows, the input appears flat and lacks necessary creases. Consequently, achieving a natural-looking butt shape becomes challenging. For optimal results, we recommend inputs that feature authentic creases, body shape, and ideal shadows, as this will allow the output to accurately reflect these characteristics.

## Common issues to address before sending out the inputs:

### Garment Drape and Logo Issues with 3D Input Garments

1. **Unintended Bunching:**
   - The fabric is bunching at the back hook area, which can distort the intended appearance of the garment in final renders.

2. **Checking Logo Color:**
   - Ensure that the elastic parts of the garments that display the brand name maintain consistent colors between different garment pieces (e.g., tops and bottoms) to ensure brand consistency.

3. **Logo Continuity:**
   - It’s crucial to check that logos on elastics or seams are continuous and do not get cut off or appear misaligned in the input files. This helps in maintaining the professional look of the rendered images.

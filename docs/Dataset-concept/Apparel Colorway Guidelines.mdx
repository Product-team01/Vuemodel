# Input Requirement

Colorways and prints are an essential aspect of design and play a significant role in the overall aesthetics of a product. When designing garments, colorways are carefully selected to create variations in the appearance of the fabric, offering different options to suit various design needs.

Vuemodel utilizes a product image shot on a mannequin, which can then be applied to a number of models of varying sizes and poses. Similarly, the provided colorways can be applied across different products, or multiple colorways can be applied to a single product, resulting in a reduced number of product shoots.

Follow this guide to effectively produce optimal quality colorways.

## Swatch Requirements

Swatch provided should be wide, straight, even, and level (without folds) or seamless (repeatable, in case of smaller swatches).

### Ways to Provide Pattern Swatches

**Option 1 (Recommended for realistic depiction)** - The fabric can be hung utilizing rods or stands to capture the entire surface area.

**Option 2** - In case a stand is unavailable, the fabric can be held manually next to the mannequin, while providing more visibility to the fabric surface area. (In the provided example, the width of the fabric is not sufficient to be accurately generated with scale without breaking the fabric).

**Option 3 (Recommended for accurate representation of colour and details)** - A seamless pattern swatch (physical or digital swatch) can also be provided with dimensions for the overall accuracy of how much space the patterns cover over the fabric.

References for the above cases have been demonstrated here:

### Seamless Pattern Swatch

The swatch image should be high resolution (in .png/.tiff/.ai/.psd etc) and seamless for accurate repeatability.

It should be a flat-lay in neutral lighting, with no inconsistencies or shade variations within the swatch.

### Challenges of Non-seamless Pattern Swatch

Non-seamless pattern swatches will cause discontinuity of pattern at joints, rendering the outputs incorrect.

### Scaling for Prints

In the absence of a relative scale (mannequin and fabric in same image - Recommended), the following methods can be used for scaling:

**Option 1** - Always provide the dimensions, as the same swatch can be interpreted in multiple sizes.

**Option 2** - A CAD/flat sketch of the garment with the scaled print render can also be provided to depict the print size.

**Option 3** - Placing a scale along with the swatch while shooting is also beneficial, as long as the swatch is not wrinkled or distorted by camera angles.

## Colour Swatches

With respect to a color swatch, when the swatch is pinned to the garment (in addition to the image of just the garment), background, or mannequin, the color of the swatch will react to the same lighting conditions as the garment.

In contrast, with a digital swatch, there is no lighting reaction, which can result in a slight discrepancy in color representation. The color in the swatch is the absolute Pantone shade, whereas both the model and the garment can undergo variations in color due to lighting conditions.

A digital swatch is generally sufficient for generating designs, despite the possibility of a slight difference between digital colors and actual fabric tones.

For larger swatches, it is recommended to aim for even lighting throughout the swatch to achieve a more uniform appearance.

Avoid providing different versions of the same swatch.

## Best Practices

- Avoid providing tiny swatches, as repeating them would result in an inaccurate representation of the fabric.
- Pinning the swatch on the garment will be feasible only if the pattern is easily repeatable. The print will be generated in proportion to the garment in the image. However, it is important to avoid any folds in the swatch.
- Ensure that the swatches are not crinkled or folded, as these imperfections can transfer onto the generated image, resulting in an unflattering appearance.
- For the best possible result, choose midtone colors for the base product. Using black or white base garments can negatively impact the output quality.
- Similarly, extreme changes from light to dark colors or vice versa can limit the potential for quality. Best quality can be achieved by using a base color that is most neutral so the difference is minimized.

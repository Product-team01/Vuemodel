# Product Shooting Guidelines

## Accepted and Non-Accepted Images

We accept mannequin, ghost mannequin images, and 3D input garments.

We **DO NOT** accept flat lay or hanger images. 

### Example of Mannequin Image

**(Most preferred)**

<!-- Add Mannequin image example here -->

### Example of Ghost Images

### Examples of a 3D Garment Image

## Color of Mannequin

The mannequin should be a white or neutral (gray/flesh), light-colored mannequin. Shooting darker mannequins may cause the color of the mannequin to blend with many products, and shooting colored mannequins can result in a color cast on the product (as shown), which will appear in the output if present.

A skin-colored mannequin or a mannequin covered in a skin-colored bodysuit is preferred for lace garments to avoid design distortion/overlap and lost transparency levels.

A skin-colored mannequin will help differentiate the front/back of the product while maintaining the intricacy of the pattern during generation.

An overlap in the front and back of the lace pattern will affect generation and will be reflected in the output.

<!-- Add images showing the effect of mannequin color here -->

## Lighting

There are many different ways to achieve the same lighting effect, and different studios use different lighting equipment, so we do not give specific lighting setup guidance.

Instead, we encourage you to match the model and product lighting as closely as possible, and to target well-lit images with simple, soft, diffused shadows with a slight directional bias (right or left) for the best results. Avoid high-contrast, strong-shadowed lighting, as well as using lighting that fills in shadows too significantly. Shadows provide shape and feature information about the product, so avoid lighting that removes them.

Below is an example of well-matched lighting between product inputs:

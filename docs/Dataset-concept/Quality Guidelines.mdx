# Product Shooting Guidelines

## Minimizing Creases, Wrinkles, and Strong Folds

Minimize the creases, wrinkles, and strong folds in the sleeves and garment.

If any folds, tie-ups, buttons, etc., are present - they should be shot in the same way they would be worn. Below are some examples:

- The jacket partially zipped, pockets buttoned, and collar folded.
- The dress back-image with lacing properly tightened with a neat bow, as would be typically worn.
- The back collar should be folded so that it falls along the same line as the shoulders and the neck area does not look extended.

## Sleeve Placements

- Sleeves should be draped and filled out - as it would be on a person.
- Sleeves should be placed a little away from the torso of the garment when possible.

**Example to avoid:**

## Bottomwear (Midriff) Placement

- The crotch area should be smoothened out without any additional creases/wedges on the mannequin as it would be on a person.
- The waistband should be placed with accurate rise, as this fit/positioning influences the generation and will be reflected in outputs.

## Key Pointers

### Reminders for Best Quality Product Photos

- In case of side angles where the product’s sleeves obscure visibility of the torso, an additional image should be supplied with the arm of the product moved to expose the torso.
- The mannequin’s arms have to be placed away from the body to avoid distortion of cuff and sleeve details.
- Minimize the creases, wrinkles, and strong folds in the garment.
- If any folds, tie-ups, buttons, etc., are present - they should be shot in the same way they would be worn.
- The back collar should be folded so that it falls along the same line as the shoulders.
- Sleeves should be draped and filled out - as it would be on a person.
- The crotch and the waistband should be smoothed and placed on the mannequin in such a way as it would be on a person.
- The lighting should be white-balanced appropriately so that the colors represented by the product are accurate, and all details visible.
- Avoid design distortion/overlap and loss of transparency levels.

# Product Shooting Guidelines

## Front and Back

Product shots must be provided for all respective angles in the desired output views. We support Front, Back, and 90-degree angles. The input views of the product must match the angle of the models used.

### Front and Back
The front and back product shots must have the garments fitted as close to the mannequin size as possible, in order to represent the most accurate fitting. The arms and sleeves of the garment must be kept in a neutral position with some space between the torso and arms, and also to see the full sleeve details. The mannequin's arm/hands should not cover any portion of the front of the mannequin which might disrupt the front shot.

**Sample images of front and back input images below.**

## Side Shot Angles - 90 Degree Side

Side mannequin shots should be in the same position as the model pose being used to avoid design detail loss. The mannequin’s arm must also be placed in a fairly neutral position.

Side angles where the product’s sleeves or the mannequin arms obscure visibility of the torso require an additional image supplied with the arm of the product and mannequin moved to expose the torso. This can be done by rotating the mannequin arm, removing the arm and rolling the sleeve up, or for sleeveless products, simply removing the mannequin arm completely.

In total, for each side angle, we require at least 3 images per product (examples below). For short sleeve garments, you can shoot the side angle without the mannequin arms hiding the torso.

### Example 1

**Image 1**

The left arm of the mannequin is intact and full sleeves of the garment draped as typically worn.

**Image 2**

The arm of the mannequin is detached and the sleeve is tucked in order to show the side torso area of the garment.

**Image 3**

The arm of the mannequin is detached and the sleeve is rolled up in order to show the side torso area of the garment.

<!-- Add Image 3 here -->

### Example 2

In the above images, the mannequin arm has been rotated to the side or moved up, so that the side torso area of the garment is visible clearly.

<!-- Add Example 2 images here -->

### Example 3

For sleeveless garments, the arm can simply be detached so that the side torso details are clearly visible. The garment should match the angle the model is standing in.

In the examples above, for 90-degree outputs, we need a full 90-degree model pose (Image 1) to support this angle. The second two poses (Image 2) are not usable, as they are not aligned with the input angle. The model poses are rotated and not at a 90-degree angle.

When the mannequin arm is too close to the body, the sleeve and cuff details of the other go missing in such poses. Mannequin arms have to be placed away from the body.

If the mannequin arm is too close to the body, garment sleeves can get crushed and affect output quality.

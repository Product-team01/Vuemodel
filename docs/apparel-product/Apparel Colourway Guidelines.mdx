## Input Requirement

Colorways and prints are integral elements of garment design, significantly influencing the overall aesthetics of a product. Carefully selected colorways offer diverse options to meet various design requirements. VueModel employs a product image captured on a mannequin, adaptable to models of varying sizes and poses. Likewise, provided colorways can be applied across different products, reducing the need for multiple product shoots.

To ensure accurate depiction of pattern swatches, several options are available:

- Option 1 (Recommended for realistic depiction): Hang the fabric using rods or stands to capture the entire surface area, providing an authentic representation of the pattern.
- Option 2: If stands are unavailable, hold the fabric manually next to the mannequin, prioritizing visibility of the fabric surface area. Note that this method may not accurately convey scale if the fabric width is insufficient.
- Option 3: (Recommended for accurate representation of color and details): Provide a seamless pattern swatch, either physically or digitally, with dimensions to ensure precise coverage over the fabric, enhancing overall accuracy.

**Note**: Swatch provided should be wide, straight, even, and at equal level. In case of smaller swatches, the swatches must be seamlessly scanned or shot.

## Seamless Pattern Swatch

- The swatch image should be high resolution (in .png/.tiff/.ai/.psd etc) and seamless for accurate repeatability.
- It should be a flat-lay in neutral lighting, with no inconsistencies or shade variations within the swatch.

## Challenges of Non-seamless Pattern Swatch

- Non-seamless pattern swatches will cause discontinuity of pattern at joints, rendering the outputs incorrect.

## Scaling Methods

In the absence of a relative scale, the following methods can be used for scaling:

### Option 1
- Always provide the dimensions, as the same swatch can be interpreted in multiple sizes.

### Option 2
- A CAD/flat sketch of the garment with the scaled print render can also be provided to depict the print size.

### Option 3
- Placing a scale along with the swatch while shooting is also beneficial, as long as the swatch is not wrinkled or distorted by camera angles.

## Colour Swatches

When utilizing a pinned color swatch on the garment, background, or mannequin, its color will conform to the same lighting conditions as the garment itself. Conversely, digital swatches lack lighting reaction, potentially resulting in minor color discrepancies. The digital swatch represents the absolute Pantone shade, while variations in lighting may affect the color of both the model and garment. Despite the possibility of slight differences between digital colors and actual fabric tones, digital swatches are generally sufficient for design generation. For larger swatches, ensure even lighting throughout to achieve uniform appearance. Avoid providing multiple versions of the same swatch to maintain consistency.

## Best Practices

- To ensure accurate representation of fabric, avoid providing tiny swatches that may lead to inaccuracies when repeated.
- Pinning swatches onto garments is feasible only if patterns are easily repeatable; however, ensure no folds in the swatch to prevent distortion.
- Swatches should be smooth and unwrinkled to avoid imperfections in the generated image.
- Choose mid-tone colors for the base product to optimize output quality; extremes like black or white can negatively impact results.
- Optimal quality is achieved with a neutral base color, minimizing differences in tone for best results.

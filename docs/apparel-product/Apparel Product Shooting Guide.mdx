## Color of Mannequin

For optimal product presentation and image quality, it is recommended to utilize a white or neutral (such as gray or flesh-tone) light-colored mannequin for photography purposes. 

Darker mannequins may inadvertently blend with certain products, while colored mannequins can introduce unwanted color casts onto the photographed items. Specifically for lace garments, employing a skin-colored mannequin or one clad in a skin-toned body suit is highly advantageous. This approach minimizes design distortion and prevents transparency loss, particularly crucial for intricate lace patterns. Additionally, a skin-toned mannequin aids in distinguishing between the front and back of the garment, preserving the intricacy of the design elements. 

Failure to adhere to these guidelines may result in compromised image quality and affect the generation process, particularly when intricate patterns overlap or distort due to improper mannequin selection. Therefore, employing a suitable mannequin ensures the accurate representation of products while optimizing the output quality of generated images. 

Lighting


While specific lighting setup guidance isn't provided due to variations in studio equipment, we strongly recommend closely matching model and product lighting. Aim for well-lit images with soft, diffused shadows and a slight directional bias (either right or left) for optimal results. Avoid high-contrast, strong-shadowed lighting, as well as excessive shadow filling, as shadows provide essential shape and feature information about the product.

## Quality Guidelines 


- Minimize the creases, wrinkles and strong folds in the sleeves and garment.
- Folds, tie-ups, buttons, and other elements should be arranged and photographed to accurately reflect their intended appearance when worn.

## Sleeve Placements:


- Sleeves should be appropriately draped and filled to emulate their natural appearance as they would when worn by an individual.
- Sleeves should be placed a little away from the torso of the garment.
- If the mannequin arm is too close to the body, garment sleeves can get crushed and affect output quality.

## Bottomwear (midriff) placement:


- The crotch area should be smoothed out without any additional creases/wedges on the mannequin as it would be on a person.
- The waistband should be placed with accurate rise, as this fit/positioning influences the generation and will be reflected in outputs.

## Side Shot Angles - 90 Degree Side
- Ensure side mannequin shots mirror the pose used by the model to prevent loss of design details. 
Position the mannequin's arm neutrally to maintain consistency. 
- In instances where product sleeves or mannequin arms obstruct the torso's visibility, provide an additional image with the arm adjusted to expose the torso. This can be achieved by rotating the mannequin arm, removing it, or rolling up the sleeve. For sleeveless products, removing the mannequin arm entirely suffices. 
- For each side angle, provide a minimum of 3 images per product. Short sleeve garments may be photographed without mannequin arms hiding the torso

**Model Pose Alignment**: Ensure that the garment matches the angle at which the model is standing. For 90-degree outputs, a full 90-degree model pose (image 1) is necessary to support this angle effectively. Other poses (image 2) that are not aligned with the input angle are not usable, as they deviate from the required 90-degree orientation. It is essential to maintain consistency in model poses to ensure alignment with the desired output angles.


**Product shots must be provided for all respective angles in the desired output views. VueModel supports front, back, side 90-degree, and side 45-degree angles. The input views of the product must correspond to the angles of the models used.**

Suggestions for optimum quality product shots:

- For side angles where the product's sleeves obscure visibility of the torso, it is recommended to provide an additional image with the arm of the product adjusted to expose the torso.
- Front and Back Shots: Ensure that the garments in front and back product shots closely adhere to mannequin size for accurate fitting representation. Maintain a neutral position for the arms and sleeves, leaving space between the torso and arms to showcase full sleeve details. Avoid obstructing the front shot by ensuring that the mannequin's arm/hands do not cover any portion of the front.
- Ensure that the mannequin's arms are positioned away from the body to prevent distortion of cuff and sleeve details.
- Minimize creases, wrinkles, and pronounced folds in the garment.
- When folds, tie-ups, buttons, etc., are present, they should be photographed in the manner they would be worn.
- The back collar should be folded to align along the same line as the shoulders.
- Sleeves should be draped and filled out to mimic natural wear on a person.
- Smooth and position the crotch and waistband of the garment on the mannequin to simulate how it would appear on a person.
- Adjust the lighting to ensure appropriate white balance, accurately representing product colors and visible details.
- Take precautions to avoid design distortion, overlap, and loss of transparency levels.

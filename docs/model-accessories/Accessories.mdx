# Accessories

## Measurements Required: 

- For bags: Model's height (for bags with straps)
- For jewellery: Height of the model, face length, ear measurements (for earrings)
- For sunglasses: Model’s face dimensions
**Makeup**: Adherence to typical brand guidelines for makeup is suggested. However, we recommend opting for neutral looks that can complement various accessories. In cases where visible tattoos are not desired, they should be covered with makeup or addressed during post-production. Fingernails should be clean, with nude-colored polish preferred unless specified otherwise.
**Hair**: Hairstyles should align with the model’s natural aesthetic. It is encouraged to allocate a portion of the shoot for hairstyles with the hair up, off the shoulders, as well as a portion with the hair down and placed behind the ears. This approach provides a versatile range suitable for different product categories. Please ensure that hair is styled in a manner that does not interfere with the product. If the model’s hair proves difficult to manage in this way, it is recommended to secure it in a loose bun or ponytail.

**Clothing**: Models are expected to be attired and styled in accordance with specified requirements. It is imperative that the chosen clothing does not obstruct the visibility of the product. For instance, if the model wears a shirt, ensuring that the collar is unbuttoned allows for optimal showcasing of accessories such as necklaces or chains.
**Lighting**: Consistency in lighting is of utmost importance across both model and product photoshoots. The primary objective is to ensure uniformity between the lighting of the model and the product images. In instances of uncertainty, efforts should be made to align the lighting setup with that of the product. While the utilization of the brand’s specific lighting aesthetic is permitted, it is advised to prioritize the use of soft, diffused lighting for an optimal outcome. Please avoid harsh shadows, bright highlights & full white backdrops/backgrounds that impede the transparency of gemstones.

It is recommended to take headshots/close crops where the model pose is appropriate for various jewelry categories like earrings, necklaces, bracelets, watches, and rings.

## Model Poses for Purse/Bag

**Handbags**: The bags can be shown in the side angles - either the 45 angle or the 90 angle. In some cases, they can also be shown in the front pose. The key here is to ensure there are at least 1-2 model poses shot with the model’s hand’s slightly clenched as she would when holding a hand held bag.
Crossbody/Sling bags: There are no specific arm or leg positions required as these bag types can be easily shown on either a front or side angles. 


**Totes/Shoulder bags**: The model can be posed in the side angle with the arms bent naturally as they would while holding a shoulder bag. The arms can also be simply let down like a standard 90 degree pose.  

**Backpacks**: Most standard back poses of the model will work without needing any specific arm or leg movements.

## Model Poses for Purse/Bag

**Handbags:** The bags can be shown in the side angles - either the 45 angle or the 90 angle. In some cases, they can also be shown in the front pose. The key here is to ensure there are at least 1-2 model poses shot with the model’s hand’s slightly clenched as she would when holding a hand held bag.

**Crossbody/Sling bags:** There are no specific arm or leg positions required as these bag types can be easily shown on either a front or side angles.

**Totes/Shoulder bags:** The model can be posed in the side angle with the arms bent naturally as they would while holding a shoulder bag. The arms can also be simply let down like a standard 90 degree pose.

**Backpacks:** Most standard back poses of the model will work without needing any specific arm or leg movements.
